In his hand there is a flower, showing his appreciation of beauty.

He takes the power of the Universe and channels it through his own body and directs it to the physical plane. Above the Magician's head is the symbol of eternity and around his waist is a snake biting its own tail, another symbol of eternity. His magical table holds all four suits of the Tarot, each of which represents one of the four primordial elements of the alchemists â€“ earth, air, fire and water. These symbolise the appropriate use of mind, heart, body and soul in the process of manifestation.

The tapestry hung between the pillars keeps the casual onlookers out and allows only those initiated to enter. The pomegranates on the tapestry are sacred to Persephone. They are a symbol of duty (because Persephone ate a pomegranate seed in the underworld which forced her to return every year). The blue robe the Priestess is wearing is a symbol of knowledge. She is wearing the crown of Isis (although she has the lunar crescent at her feet, not on her head) and on her lap is a Torah scroll, indicating her connection with the Hebrew tradition and the Tree of Life, which mentions wisdom.",

As an archetype, it is common to see masculine figures of authority or father figures with long white beards. These include Father Christmas, Merlin, and Gandalf. He wears armor, another indication of experience, and his red robes imply the fiery passion of the masculine principle. He sits upon a cubic stone, a symbol of the physical world and his own control of it.
